Welcome to DOOPs. These are random collections of scripts that we use when making websites or projects. Sometimes these are ripped from the core TrafficCake project and as a result may need tweaking to ensure they are secure or working 100%. Never the less we try to ensure they are in a great state before uploading them to Github.
